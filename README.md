# Implementation of Neural Networks for Automated Medical Image Diagnosis

This repository contains the results and progress of the graduation project titled **"Implementation of Neural Networks for Automated Medical Image Diagnosis."** The main objective of this project is to develop a program based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for detecting and classifying diseases such as brain tumors and Alzheimer's using MRI scans, as well as tuberculosis and pneumonia from chest X-rays.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Prototipo/**: Contains the source code of the prototype developed for disease detection and classification.
- **Reporte/**: Includes a detailed report of the project, covering everything from the literature review to the obtained results and conclusions.
- **.vscode/**: Contains specific configurations for the Visual Studio Code development environment used during the project.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies which files or directories should be ignored by Git.

## Project Description

This project focuses on the application of deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks, for the automated diagnosis of diseases using medical images. The following pathologies have been addressed:

- **Brain Tumors**: Classification and detection using MRI brain scans.
- **Alzheimer's Disease**: Early detection through MRI analysis.
- **Tuberculosis and Pneumonia**: Diagnosis based on chest X-rays.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Main Libraries**:
  - PyTorch
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib


## Results

Detailed results, including performance metrics and prediction analysis, can be found in the `Reporte/` directory. Additionally, visualizations such as confusion matrices and ROC curves for each developed model are included.

## Contributions

This project was developed by **Andrés Nuila**, a student at **UNITEC**, as part of the graduation work for obtaining the degree in **Computer Science Emgineering**.
